+// A GT_JCMP node is created when a comparison and conditional branch

+//
+// Arm64 has a few instructions with this behavior.
+//   - cbz/cbnz -- Compare and branch register zero/not zero
+//   - tbz/tbnz -- Test and branch register bit zero/not zero
+//
+// A GT_JCMP cbz/cbnz node is created when there is a GT_EQ or GT_NE
+// integer/unsigned comparison against #0 which is used by a GT_JTRUE
+// condition jump node.

+// A GT_JCMP cbz/cbnz node is created when there is a GT_TEST_EQ or GT_TEST_NE
+// integer/unsigned comparison against against a mask with a single bit set

+// This node is repsonsible for consuming the register, and emitting the
+// appropriate fused compare/test and branch instruction

+// Two flags guide code generation
+//    GTF_JCMP_TST -- Set if this is a tbz/tbnz rather than cbz/cbnz
